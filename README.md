# Daily Python Challenges

Welcome to my daily Python repo! I'm using this repo to build consistency, improve my problem-solving skills, and grow my confidence in Python through small daily projects, challenges, and experiments.

## Structure
Each day has its own folder (`day_01/`, `day_02/`, etc.) and typically includes:
- Python script(s)
- Notes or reflections
- Links to any external resources used

## Goals
- Strengthen my core Python skills
- Explore automation, APIs, and scripting
- Practice data analysis and visualization
- Apply concepts from problem-solving and algorithms
- Get hands-on with ML and real-world mini-projects

## Progress Log

| Day | Summary |
|-----|---------|
| 1   | day 1 summary |
| 2   | day 2 summary |
| 3   | day 3 summary |
| ... | ... |

## Tools
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
- Python 3.x
- pandas, requests, matplotlib, etc.
